# Chat Client
## Reason for the project
This project is here for just practicing react and redux. It was also a test for me to take a design from UI ( designed in Lunacy ) to an actual program.

## Caution
### This project is still MASSIVE WIP. Do not judge this as a final work
Creating UI [DONE]
Implement Top-Down-DataFlow [80%]
Implement WebSocket Communication [0%]

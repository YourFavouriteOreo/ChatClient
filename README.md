# Chat Client
## Reason for the project
This project is here for just practicing React and Redux) . It was also a test for me to take a design from UI ( designed in Lunacy ) to an actual program.

## Caution
### This project is still MASSIVE WIP. Do not judge this as a final work
- Creating UI [ 80% ]
- Implement Top-Down-DataFlow [ 80% ]
- Implement WebSocket Communication [ 0% ]
- Security Encryption [ 0% ]

## Thank you for taking an interest in my work!!!

### Made with ❤️ and  ☕
